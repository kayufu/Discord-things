If you ever have found this message. This is why i decided to delete this discord account

"I still feel deeply depressed because of past events over the recent period. I still can't forget them — every time they come to mind, I sink back into those painful thoughts and memories. I just want to run away and bury that past. I don't ever want to remember it again, or how badly I treated the friends I once had. I'll delete this Discord account and start using a new Steam account. I don't hate you you. If you guy don't completely hate me, you can contact me here if you guys still like me: Discord: @kayufu . I’ll be probably less talking than before. I just don't want to be seen as a bad person in others' eyes or keep having nightmares because of all this. I'm tired of this. I just wanna to hide, I'm just a bad person after all. I'm sorry for doing this again. Forgive me everyone"
